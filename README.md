# natsctl
The simplest CLI, but one of the most useful ever! If you ever wanted to use NATS client within your bash :D

## Inspiration
My mainly inspiration was the `kubectl` command line interface, for controlling the Kubernetes cluster, so I decided to build my own for my favorite message system! [NATS](https://www.nats.io/) is a Go based message system, responsible for enabling me one of my best messaging experiences! Pretty simple, easy to configure, and the only fault was the problem that there is no way that I can find some metrics inside my terminal, and **I DON'T LIKE WEB INTERFACES SORRY!** so, using a talk on the [Nerdz√£o Community](http://meetup.com/pt-BR/nerdzao), I'll build this tool according to what I feel is cool, but if you want to help me or put some feature that you consider cool, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Horaddrim/natsctl/issues/new) and lets discuss this!

#### TO DO
- [ ] Add the documentation for building the tool from source
- [ ] Add documentation for downloading a precompiled version
- [ ] Add the ISSUE TEMPLATE
- [ ] Think about support Windows versions
- [ ] Upgrade the code documentation too
