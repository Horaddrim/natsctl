# natsctl
The simplest CLI, but one of the most useful ever! If you ever wanted to use NATS client within your bash :D

## Inspiration
My main inspiration was the `kubectl` command line interface, for controlling the Kubernetes cluster. So I decided to build my own for my favorite message system! [NATS](https://nats.io) is a Go based messaging system, responsible for (retirei texto) one of my best messaging experiences! It's Pretty simple, easy to configure, and the only fault was that there is no way that I can find some metrics inside my terminal, and **I DON'T LIKE WEB INTERFACES SORRY!**. Then, within a talk on the [Nerdz√£o Community](http://meetup.com/pt-BR/nerdzao), I'll build this tool according to what I feel is cool, but if you want to help me or put some feature that you consider cool, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Horaddrim/natsctl/issues/new) and lets discuss this!

#### TO DO
- [ ] Add the documentation for building the tool from source
- [ ] Add documentation for downloading a precompiled version
- [ ] Add the ISSUE TEMPLATE
- [ ] Think about support Windows versions
- [ ] Upgrade the code documentation too
